## **Restaurant Clustering, Recommendation, and Rating Prediction Project** ##

This project consists of three main parts:

#### **Clustering of Restaurants in Madrid** 🗺️ ####
We applied clustering techniques using the **DBSCAN** and **KMeans** algorithms to group restaurants in Madrid. The different clusters are formed based on various characteristics, primarily the type of cuisine, and are mainly differentiated by price range. This part of the project provides a structured view of the diversity of restaurants in the city and their target audience.

#### **Restaurant Recommenders** 🍽️ ####
We developed two restaurant recommenders, one focused on Madrid and the other on Mexico, through an **interactive web application** created with the **Streamlit** library. These recommenders are based on the ratings users give to a series of restaurants. Using this information, the system recommends other similar restaurants based on their characteristics. This functionality provides users with personalized suggestions based on their culinary preferences.

#### **Rating Prediction Model** 🌟 ####
We implemented a predictive model to estimate restaurant ratings based on user reviews. We achieved a prediction rate of over 50%, providing valuable insights into how users evaluate different restaurants.

This project reflects our interest in exploring and applying unsupervised learning, recommendation, and prediction techniques in the restaurant industry context, offering useful insights and practical solutions. **Explore the code and enjoy the features offered by each component!** 🚀
